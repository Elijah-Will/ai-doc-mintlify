# WordPress ACF Setup

## Introduction

Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) is a powerful WordPress plugin that allows you to add custom fields to your content, providing flexibility and control over your website's data.

## Accessing the WordPress Backend

To set up ACF and manage custom fields, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to WordPress Admin:**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to your WordPress site's admin dashboard (typically at `yourdomain.com/wp-admin`).
   - Enter your username and password to log in.

2. **Navigating to ACF:**
   - Once logged in, look for the "Custom Fields" menu item in the WordPress dashboard.
   - Click on "Custom Fields" to access the ACF settings.

## Creating ACF Fields

Now that you're in the ACF settings, let's create a new set of custom fields:

1. **Field Groups:**
   - In the ACF dashboard, click on "Field Groups."
   - Click "Add New" to create a new group for your custom fields.

2. **Adding Fields:**
   - Within the new group, click "Add Field" to start defining your custom fields.
   - For each field, specify the field type (text, image, etc.), label, and any additional settings.

3. **Assigning Fields to Content:**
   - After creating fields, go to "Location" and specify where these fields should appear (e.g., on pages, posts, custom post types).
   - Save your field group.

4. **Editing Content with ACF Fields:**
   - Now, when you edit a page or post, you'll see the custom fields you've created in the WordPress editor.
   - Populate these fields with the desired content.

## Displaying ACF Content

To display the ACF content on your site:

1. **In Your Theme:**
   - In your theme files (e.g., `single.php`, `page.php`), use the `get_field` function to retrieve and display ACF values.

   ```php
   <?php
   $custom_field_value = get_field('your_custom_field');
   echo $custom_field_value;
   ?>
